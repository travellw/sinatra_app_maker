# Sinatra App Maker
A Ruby command line application for quickly architecting Sinatra apps

## Introduction

---

Sinatra is a flexible, lightweight, and fun framework for building web applications. It can be used to make microservices, personal websites, prototypes, etc. Unlike Ruby on Rails, Sinatra does not have the magical power of automation. Every element (folders, directories, etc) must be created by the developer. This can be tedious for frequent users or unflattering for those who want to just want to get started. This tool adds a little Ruby on Rails automation to Sinatra for a more accessible developer experience.

1. Clone the repo on to your local machine
2. `cd` into the project directory
3. Run `ruby app.rb` 
4. Declare the name of the app by responding to the prompt - 'What is the Apps' name'?
5. Once the creation prompt completes, `cd` into the project directory resembling the name you shared in step 4. 
6. Run `ruby app.rb`
7. While the server is running in your terminal, navigate to localhost:4567 within your browser.
8. Observe a 'Welcome to Sinatra' page.
